# MODULE-2-VBA: Stock Analyses using VBA Excel Macro

## Overview of Project
Steve's parents have been investing in a "green" company that they felt were the best investment. Steve, on the other hand, is not certain that they had all the facts at hand to make a good determination. He asked for help in analyzing whether their investment plan was appropriately set on the best company, "DQ" (DAQO New Energy Corp.). They had chosen this company because it produces "green" energy and they have a high interest in supporting sustainable energy sources that do not affect the environment negatively. We are attempting to broaden their outlook by analyzing starting and ending prices on stocks of 11 other companies.


## Results
We used stock prices from the years 2017 and 2018 for the 12 companies, including "DQ".

Below are the tables depicting beginning prices and overall return calculated for the year for each company's stock.

## Summary
There are very clear choices that will, based on the last 2 years of data, produce a nice return for Steve's parents.
